OpenVPN - Setup
===============
1. Reserve an IP address for you raspberry (from your router), e.g. 10.3.3.10

2. Configure that static IP on eth0 in /etc/dhcpcd.conf
	interface eth0
	static ip_address=10.3.3.10
	static routers=10.3.3.1

3. Get a free DNS entry for your router on https://freemyip.com

4. Register the return URL, it will be used later on

5. Create an unpriviledge user
	useradd -m ovpn-admin
6. Run
	curl -L https://install.pivpn.io/ | bash
   and provide the followings to the TUI:
      - 
      - use eth0
      - insert you RPi static IP (e.g. 10.3.3.10)
      - select the newly created user ovpn-admin
      - that you want to install OpenVPN
      - use 'UDP'
      - declare openvpn process port (e.g. 11111)
      - choose you DNS server (use custom if you want your router to be your DNS server)
      - insert the DNS entry (see point 3 in this guide)
      - go ahead with reccomended options

7. Let openvpn update your router IP whenever started
	systemctl edit openvpn
		[Service]
		ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/curl "<use the URL registered at point 4>"

8. Reload daemons
	systemctl daemon-reload

8. Configure your router for port forwarding (router:11111 -> RPi:11111)

9. Reboot your raspberry


OpenVPN - Adding Client
=======================
1. Generate you users credentials with
	pivpn add nopass
   
   remove nopass if you want to enforce security providing pw to login to your VPN

2. Export the newly created file (located at /home/ovpn-admin/ovpns) and import in your device
